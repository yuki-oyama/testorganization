Michel Bierlaire holds a PhD in Mathematical Sciences from the University of Namur, Belgium. From 1995 to 1998, he served as a research associate and project manager at the Intelligent Transportation Systems Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, Cambridge, Ma). Following this, he joined the Operations Research group ROSO within the Institute of Mathematics at EPFL as junior faculty, a position he held from 1998 to 2006. In 2006, he was appointed Associate Professor in the School of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering at EPFL, where he now directs the Transport and Mobility Laboratory. In 2012, he was appointed full professor in the same school. 

Dr. Bierlaire’s expertise lies in the design, development, and application of models and algorithms for transportation system analysis, design, and management. His work includes significant contributions to demand modeling, such as discrete choice models and the estimation of origin-destination matrices, as well as operations research topics like scheduling and assignment, and dynamic traffic management systems.

He is the founder of hEART, the European Association for Research in Transportation. Additionally, he served as the founding Editor-in-Chief of the EURO Journal on Transportation and Logistics from 2011 to 2019 and has been an Associate Editor of Operations Research since 2012.
