To accommodate the overwhelming number of submissions we received (thank you so much!), we have adjusted the schedule to <span style="color: red;">**start sessions on Sunday**</span>. 
This change allows us to maximize the number of presentation slots and include as many valuable contributions as possible.

### Special Program on Sunday Afternoon
   On Sunday afternoon, we will host three **Plenary sessions** in succession, followed by a **Welcome Party**. 
   We hope you can join us for an engaging start to the conference and meaningful networking opportunities.

### Weekday Sessions
   From Monday to Friday, there will be **three or four parallel sessions running from morning to evening**, featuring a wide variety of engaging presentations.
   We are also planning some social activities!

### Arrive Early Recommendation
   Given the updated start on Sunday, we highly recommend <span style="color: red;">**booking your travel to arrive in Okinawa by Saturday**</span>. 
   We encourage you to adjust your plans to fully participate in all Sunday activities.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation! The detailed program will be announced soonâ€”stay tuned!
