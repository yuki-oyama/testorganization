Hello everyone,

The Steering Committee of **TRISTAN**, *the Triennial Symposium on Transportation Analysis* series of international conferences, 
seeks Expressions of Interests for organizing TRISTAN XIII to be held in June of 2028.

TRISTAN provides a high-quality forum for the presentation of innovative and thought-provoking models, methodologies, and applications in Transportation Science, 
mainly Operations Research-oriented (including analytics, learning, AI, and simulation). 
The scope is wide, covering both people and freight transportation and logistics, by all modes, at all geographical extensions, and at all levels of planning, analysis, and operations.
The TRISTAN conferences gather top research scientists from universities and research institutes from all over the world along with scientific participants from the private sectors and public agencies, as well as graduate students. 
They provide an agora for high-spirited and broad exchanges of ideas, reflections, and discussions on the topics and areas of interest,
aiming to foster scientific and social networking and international cooperation.
Extensive information on TRISTAN and the past conferences may be found
at https://tristanconference.org/

A TRISTAN conference is to be organized by a group of people acknowledged within the community. 
With respect to location, this also translates into a desire <span style="color: blue;">to be inclusive</span> and move the conference around the world where there are important or emerging groups of researchers in Transportation Science. 
<span style="color: red;">Given the Pacific and Indian oceans locations of the last conferences - Australia, Mauritius, and Japan -, proposals from locations around the Atlantic ocean are strongly encouraged.</span>

The proposals will be presented to all participants to TRISTAN XII, which will take place June 22-28 2025, on the island of Okinawa, Japan. 
The final selection will then be made by the conference participants who will vote during the social dinner on Thursday evening.

All demands for additional information and the expressions of interest to organize the 2028 TRISTAN should be set to us at <a>tristansymposium@gmail.com</a>

We take this opportunity to wish you and your sthe most wonderful year 2025!
