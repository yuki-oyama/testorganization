<!-- Please see below for a list of topics. -->
Selection for presentations at TRISTAN XII is based on the submission of extended abstracts of research.
Authors are welcome to submit more than one abstract. 
However, each registered participant is allowed to present at most one paper during the conference.

All submissions must be electronically submitted through the EasyChair conference manuscript management system.
https://easychair.org/cfp/TRISTAN2025

<br>

## Abstract Guidelines

Extended abstracts are to be written in English and should be no longer than <span style="color: red; ">4 pages</span> in length.
To facilitate the review and selection by the scientific committee, extended abstracts should clearly state the research goals, analysis methods, results, and contributions of the study.

Submissions should include the following details:

* Title
* Submission topic (as explained above)
* Up to 5 keywords
* Extended abstract
* References

NOTE: This submission is double-blinded. <span style="color: red; ">DO NOT</span> include author names or affiliations.

Templates are provided to author papers in this format for both Microsoft Word and LaTeX:

{{% staticref "uploads/TRISTAN2025_template.docx"%}}**Microsoft Word Template** {{% /staticref %}} to prepare your paper for submission.

{{% staticref "uploads/TRISTAN2025_template.zip"%}}**LaTeX ZIP**{{% /staticref %}}, for online collaborative writing; authors can create an Overleaf project using this template.
