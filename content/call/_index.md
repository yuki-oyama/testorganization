<!-- Please see below for a list of topics. -->
Selection for presentations at TRISTAN XII is based on the submission of extended abstracts of research.
Authors are welcome to submit more than one abstract. 
However, each registered participant is allowed to present at most one paper during the conference.

All submissions must be electronically submitted through the EasyChair conference manuscript management system.

## Abstract Guidelines

<ul>
<li>Extended abstracts are to be written in English.</li>
<li>All extended abstracts must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.</li>
<li>The abstracts should be no longer than <span style="color: red; ">4 pages in length.</span></li>
<li>This submission is double-blinded. <span style="color: red; ">DO NOT include author names or affiliations.</span></li>
<li>Submissions must be in <span style="color: red; ">PDF format.</span></li>
<li>To facilitate the review and selection by the scientific committee, extended abstracts should clearly state the research goals, analysis methods, results, and contributions of the study.</li>

<li>Submissions should include the following details:
<ul>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>Up to 5 keywords</li>
  <li>Extended abstract</li>
  <li>References</li>
</ul>
