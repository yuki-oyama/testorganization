Okinawa island, located in the southernmost region of Japan, offers a captivating blend of natural beauty and rich cultural heritage influenced by its history of being an independent kingdom, then later becoming a part of Japan. We are delighted to host the TRISTAN symposium in Okinawa.

You can find official travel guide to Okinawa at [VISIT OKINAWA JAPAN](https://visitokinawajapan.com/).


## Venue
The symposium will be held at the [Bankoku Shinryokan](https://www.shinryokan.com/menuIndex.jsp?id=21545&menuid=6407&funcid=28). It is located in the centeral part of Okinawa island, standing on Busena Point, one of the most scenic spots in Okinawa, surrounded by the beautiful emerald ocean and blue sky. "Bankoku Shinryo" meaning "Bridge between Nations," is named after a phrase carved on the large bell at Shuri Castle. Since the 14th century, the Ryukyu Kingdom strived to promote cultural exchange through trade with China and Southeast Asia (from the official website). We believe this is a perfect venue for the fantastic TRISTAN symposium to foster international networking and collaborations!

### History and tradition of the Ryukyu Islands
Shuri Castle (Shuri-j≈ç), located in Naha, Okinawa, is a historical landmark that once served as the palace of the Ryukyu Kingdom. Dating back to the 14th century, this castle is a symbol of Okinawa's distinct cultural heritage, blending Japanese, Chinese, and Southeast Asian architectural influences. Known for its striking red tiles and the iconic Shureimon gate, the castle showcases the unique Ryukyuan style. It functioned as the political and administrative center of the Ryukyu Kingdom for centuries. Shuri Castle has undergone several reconstructions due to wars and fires, including significant damage during World War II and a recent fire in 2019. Despite these challenges, the castle remains a testament to the resilience of Okinawan culture. 
<!--Today, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it attracts visitors worldwide, offering insights into the rich history and traditions of the Ryukyu Islands.-->

### Mangrove forests
<!--Mangroves are predominantly located in the estuaries and along the coastlines where freshwater meets seawater, creating a unique habitat. The mangroves are distinguished by their dense root systems, which not only protect shorelines from erosion but also provide a breeding ground and nursery for various marine species, including fish, crustaceans, and mollusks.-->
Mangrove forests in Okinawa are not just ecological treasures; they are also culturally significant. They have been traditionally used in local industries, such as fishing and salt production. Today, these mangroves are popular among tourists for activities like kayaking and guided nature walks, offering a chance to explore and learn about these vital ecosystems. Their importance in carbon sequestration, especially in the fight against climate change, further underscores the value of preserving Okinawa's mangroves.
