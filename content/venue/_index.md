## <a name="venue">Bankoku Shinryokan</a>

The symposium will be held at the [Bankoku Shinryokan](https://www.shinryokan.com/menuIndex.jsp?id=21545&menuid=6407&funcid=28), located in the central part of Okinawa island. It stands on Busena Point, one of the most scenic spots in Okinawa, surrounded by the beautiful emerald ocean and blue sky. "Bankoku Shinryo" meaning "Bridge between Nations," is named after a phrase carved on the large bell at Shuri Castle. Since the 14th century, the Ryukyu Kingdom strived to promote cultural exchange through trade with China and Southeast Asia (from the official website). We believe this is a perfect venue for the fantastic TRISTAN symposium to foster international networking and collaborations!
