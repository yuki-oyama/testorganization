Okinawa island, located in the southernmost region of Japan, offers a captivating blend of natural beauty and rich cultural heritage influenced by its history of being an independent kingdom, then later becoming a part of Japan.

You can find official travel guide to Okinawa at [VISIT OKINAWA JAPAN](https://visitokinawajapan.com/).


## Venue
The symposium will be held at the [Bankoku Shinryokan](https://www.shinryokan.com/menuIndex.jsp?id=21545&menuid=6407&funcid=28). It is located in the centeral part of Okinawa island, standing on Busena Point, one of the most scenic spots in Okinawa, surrounded by the beautiful emerald ocean and blue sky. "Bankoku Shinryo" meaning "Bridge between Nations," is named after a phrase carved on the large bell at Shuri Castle. Since the 14th century, the Ryukyu Kingdom strived to promote cultural exchange through trade with China and Southeast Asia (from the official website). We believe this is a perfect venue for the fantastic TRISTAN symposium to foster international networking and collaborations!
