      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are honored to announce that the Twelfth Triennial Symposium on Transportation Analysis conference (TRISTAN XII) will take place from June 22 to 27, 2025, at Bankoku Shinryokan in Okinawa, Japan (in-person only). The symposium is organized by the University of Tokyo. The TRISTAN symposium is an opportunity to showcase recent research and applications in transportation analysis and transportation science. Earlier TRISTAN symposiums have established a tradition of a symposium of high scientific quality, with lots of interaction during and outside the technical sessions, a good sense of community, and enriching and enjoyable social tours. We are expecting over 300 academics, researchers and practitioners from around the world to convene to discuss mathematical models, methodologies and computational results, and to exchange ideas on advanced applications and technologies in transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
